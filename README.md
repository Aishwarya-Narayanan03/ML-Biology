# Machine learning and complex biological data

Machine learning has proven to be an extremely useful tool in the analysis of complex biological data. Machine learning approaches can help extract significant patterns and insights from large-scale biological datasets, such as genomics, proteomics, and medical imaging, leading to new discoveries and breakthroughs in the area of biology.

## Abstract:
Machine learning has demonstrated potential for analyzing large, complex biological data. In practice, however, biological information is required in addition
to machine learning for successful application.
